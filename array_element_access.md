How can we access the element 'and' in the array ['fish', 'and', 'chips']?

### Solution
```JavaScript
let myArray = ['fish', 'and', 'chips'];
console.log(myArray[1]); // Output and
```

### Discussion
JavaScript arrays are zero-indexed: the first element of an array is at index 0, the second is at index 1, and so on.
So, we use array's name with square brackets and between the brackets we gives the index of element. which we want to access to it.
